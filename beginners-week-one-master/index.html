<p> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<ol>
  <li> HTML is cool </li>
  <li> CSS is cooler </li>
  <li> JS is the best </li>
</ol>
<h2> What do you need to create a website? </h2>
<p> Not much! </p>
<ul>
  <li> A computer (always a good start) </li>
  <li> A web browser (I am using chrome) </li>
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files </li>
<p> Follow my progress on github </p>
